            <h2>About Dayton</h2>
            <p>The Wright family were among the pioneers who settled the Northwest Territory in the early nineteenth century. 
                Their great-grandfather, Dan Wright, brought his family to Ohio in 1814 and bought a piece of land adjacent 
                to the new National Road in what is now Miami County, just north of Dayton, OH. Dan's son, Dan Jr. moved to
                 Rush County, Indiana where his son Milton – the father of the Wright brothers – was born. Milton became a 
                 preacher in the United Brethren Church, then was promoted to edit the Religious Telescope, published by the
                  United Brethren in Dayton. Milton would have other church assignments that took him and his family elsewhere,
                   but they always came back to Dayton. In 1884, the Wright family – including Orville and Wilbur Wright – moved
                    to Dayton permanently. Both Orville and Wilbur were life-long residents from that moment.<br>
